   BamFeatureTrack ==> DraggableFeatureTrack ==> FeatureTrack ==> Track

   Differences in BamFeatureTrack
         suppression of histogram -- when zoomed out too far, instead show as grayed out?
         loading is different 
                there's no trackData.js, so override load() / loadSuccess() to bootstrap
                   so bootstrapping of NCList-ish struct, setting of sublistIndex, lazyFeatIndex etc
            rough equivalent of loading trackData.js might be loading .bam header, and .bai index file ?? 
 

   Unique Identity, BAM features, and NCLists:
      The NCLists used in BAM tracks do not strictly meet the full requirements 
      for nested containment lists.  In particular, the same BAM feature can be in 
      two (or more) different NCList containers (whereas in a strict nested containment 
      list each feature could only be in one container)

      Standard JBrowse features aren't guaranteed to have a unique id/name field, but  
          each feature is guaranteed to have a unique path through the NCLists to that feature.  
          Therefore unique IDs are generated for JBrowse features based on the features path 
          in the NCLists.
          But can't do this for BAM features because two different NCList paths could lead to 
          the same feature.  
          However BAM features _are_ guaranteed to have a unique id ???
          NEED TO ENSURE BAM FEATURES HAVE UNIQUE IDS ???  
               RNAME closest to an id, but read pairs can have same RNAME
                    so (RNAME + POS) ??   should be unique?
          Therefore instead of NCList path, BAM features use ??? for determining uniqueness
      Code for this is now pushed down into FeatureTrack.getId(), and unique id field is 
          indicated for a BAM track (or other tracks with unique ids for each feature) in 
          the trackData.json with the "uniqueIdField" setting
